				S/Key
				*****


This is the port of S/key implementation from OpenBSD source tree to
Solaris, Linux, *BSD, AIX and probably other *NIX systems. 

This port consists of the introduction of autoconf support and replacement of
OpenBSD library functions that are (regrettably) absent from other unices. 

Please refer to INSTALL document for information on how to install
S/key on your system.

This port has been tested on Solaris, Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD and AIX.

All *new* code is released under XFree style license. 
The rest of the code is from OpenBSD source tree and has it's own 
licenses/copyrights, please refer to the source files for details.
